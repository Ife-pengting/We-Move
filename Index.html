<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<p>HTML is cool </p>
<p>CSS is cooler</p>
<p>JS is the best</p>

<h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>

Not much!
<p>A computer (always a good start)</p>
<p>A text editor (I am using atom)</p>
<p>A web browser (I am using chrome)</p>
<p>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</p>

<h3>Follow my progress on github!</h3>
