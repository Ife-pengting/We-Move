<h3>A Short Story by TheBes</h3>
<p>Jessica Smith was thinking about Mark Smart again. Mark was a gentle brute with squat elbows and dirty fingers.
Jessica walked over to the window and reflected on her wild surroundings. She had always loved idyllic Newton Abbot with its jealous, jittery jungle. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel concerned.
Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a gentle figure of Mark Smart.
Jessica gasped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a cowardly, arrogant, wine drinker with blonde elbows and fragile fingers. Her friends saw her as a ripe, regurgitated rover. Once, she had even made a cup of tea for a rainy old lady.
But not even a cowardly person who had once made a cup of tea for a rainy old lady, was prepared for what Mark had in store today.The wind blew like partying donkeys, making Jessica cross. Jessica grabbed a magic hawk that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.</p>

<p>As Jessica stepped outside and Mark came closer, she could see the mushy glint in his eye.
"Look Jessica," growled Mark, with a giving glare that reminded Jessica of gentle flamingos. "I hate you and I want revenge. You owe me 5780 pounds."
Jessica looked back, even more cross and still fingering the magic hawk. "Mark, get out of my house," she replied.
They looked at each other with anxious feelings, like two resonant, rabblesnatching rats rampaging at a very witty funeral, which had classical music playing in the background and two wild uncles drinking to the beat.
Suddenly, Mark lunged forward and tried to punch Jessica in the face. Quickly, Jessica grabbed the magic hawk and brought it down on Mark's skull.
Mark's squat elbows trembled and his dirty fingers wobbled. He looked stressed, his wallet raw like a manky, mute map.Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Mark Smart was dead. Jessica Smith went back inside and made herself a nice glass of wine.</p>

THE END

<h4> Smelly Shark </h4>

<p>Caring painter MS MAUREEN BLUNDER is arguing with gracious shopkeeper PROF LUKE PLATT. MAUREEN tries to hug LUKE but he shakes her off. </P>

<p>MAUREEN
Please Luke, don't leave me.
LUKE
I'm sorry Maureen, but I'm looking for somebody a bit more brave. Somebody who faces her fears head on, instead of running away.
MAUREEN
I am such a person!
LUKE frowns.</p>

<p>LUKE
I'm sorry, Maureen. I just don't feel excited by this relationship anymore.
LUKE leaves.

MAUREEN sits down, looking defeated.

Moments later, clever homemaker MRS MARY WILLIS barges in looking flustered.

MAUREEN
Goodness, Mary! Is everything okay?
MARY
I'm afraid not.
MAUREEN
What is it? Don't keep me in suspense...
MARY
It's ... a shark ... I saw an evil shark eat a bunch of pigeons!
MAUREEN
Defenseless pigeons?
MARY
Yes, defenseless pigeons!
MAUREEN
Bloomin' heck, Mary! We've got to do something.
MARY
I agree, but I wouldn't know where to start.
MAUREEN
You can start by telling me where this happened.
MARY
I was...
MARY fans herself and begins to wheeze.

MAUREEN
Focus Mary, focus! Where did it happen?
MARY
a supermarket! That's right - a supermarket!
MAUREEN springs up and begins to run.


EXT. A ROAD - CONTINUOUS

MAUREEN rushes along the street, followed by MARY. They take a short cut through some back gardens, jumping fences along the way.


EXT. A SUPERMARKET - SHORTLY AFTER

JEFF BLACKMAN a smelly shark terrorises two pigeons.

MAUREEN, closely followed by MARY, rushes towards JEFF, but suddenly stops in her tracks.

MARY
What is is? What's the matter?
MAUREEN
That's not just any old shark, that's Jeff Blackman!
MARY
Who's Jeff Blackman?
MAUREEN
Who's Jeff Blackman? Who's Jeff Blackman? Only the most smelly shark in the universe!
MARY
Blinkin' knickers, Maureen! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most smelly shark in the universe!
MAUREEN
You can say that again.
MARY
Blinkin' knickers, Maureen! We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the most smelly shark in the universe!
MAUREEN
I'm going to need rubbers, lots of rubbers.
Jeff turns and sees Maureen and Mary. He grins an evil grin.

JEFF
Maureen Blunder, we meet again.
MARY
You've met?
MAUREEN
Yes. It was a long, long time ago...

EXT. A PARK - BACK IN TIME

A young MAUREEN is sitting in a park listening to some R & B music, when suddenly a dark shadow casts over her.

She looks up and sees JEFF. She takes off her headphones.

JEFF
Would you like some chocolate?
MAUREEN's eyes light up, but then he studies JEFF more closely, and looks uneasy.

MAUREEN
I don't know, you look kind of smelly.
JEFF
Me? No. I'm not smelly. I'm the least smelly shark in the world.
MAUREEN
Wait, you're a shark?
MAUREEN runs away, screaming.


EXT. A SUPERMARKET - PRESENT DAY

JEFF
You were a coward then, and you are a coward now.
MARY
(To MAUREEN) You ran away?
MAUREEN
(To MARY) I was a young child. What was I supposed to do?
MAUREEN turns to JEFF.

MAUREEN
I may have run away from you then, but I won't run away this time!
MAUREEN runs away.

She turns back and shouts.

MAUREEN
I mean, I am running away, but I'll be back - with rubbers.
JEFF
I'm not scared of you.
MAUREEN
You should be.

EXT. GREENWICH, LONDON - LATER THAT DAY

MAUREEN and MARY walk around searching for something.

MAUREEN
I feel sure I left my rubbers somewhere around here.
MARY
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly rubbers.
MAUREEN
You know nothing Mary Willis.
MARY
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, JEFF appears, holding a pair of rubbers.

JEFF
Looking for something?
MARY
Crikey, Maureen, he's got your rubbers.
MAUREEN
Tell me something I don't already know!
MARY
The earth's circumference at the equator is about 40,075 km.
MAUREEN
I know that already!
MARY
I'm afraid of sausages.
JEFF
(appalled) Dude!
While JEFF is looking at MARY with disgust, MAUREEN lunges forward and grabs her deadly rubbers. He wields them, triumphantly.

MAUREEN
Prepare to die, you smelly cauliflower!
JEFF
No please! All I did was eat a bunch of pigeons!
LUKE enters, unseen by any of the others.

MAUREEN
I cannot tolerate that kind of behaviour! Those pigeons were defenceless! Well now they have a defender - and that's me! Maureen Blunder defender of innocent pigeons.
JEFF
Don't hurt me! Please!
MAUREEN
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't use these rubbers on you right away!
JEFF
Because Maureen, I am your father.
MAUREEN looks stunned for a few moments, but then collects herself.

MAUREEN
No you're not!
JEFF
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
JEFF tries to grab the rubbers but MAUREEN dodges out of the way.

MAUREEN
Who's the daddy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, JEFF slumps to the ground.

MARY
Did he just faint?
MAUREEN
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly rubbers.
MAUREEN crouches over JEFF's body.

MARY
Be careful, Maureen. It could be a trick.
MAUREEN
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Jeff Blackman is dead!
MAUREEN
What?
MAUREEN
Yes, it appears that I scared him to death.
MARY claps her hands.

MARY
So your rubbers did save the day, after all.
LUKE steps forward.

LUKE
Is it true? Did you kill the smelly shark?
MAUREEN
Luke how long have you been...?
LUKE puts his arm around MAUREEN.

LUKE
Long enough.
MAUREEN
Then you saw it for yourself. I killed Jeff Blackman.
LUKE
Then the pigeons are safe?
MAUREEN
It does seem that way!
A crowd of vulnerable pigeons enter, looking relived.

LUKE
You are their hero.
The pigeons bow to MAUREEN.

MAUREEN
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Jeff Blackman will never eat pigeons ever again, is enough for me.
LUKE
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the pigeons passes MAUREEN a healing bell

LUKE
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
MAUREEN
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

MAUREEN
Well, if you insist.
MAUREEN takes the bell.

MAUREEN
Thank you.
The pigeons bow their heads once more, and leave.

MAUREEN turns to LUKE.

MAUREEN
Does this mean you want me back?
LUKE
Oh, Maureen, of course I want you back!
MAUREEN smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.

MAUREEN
Well you can't have me.
LUKE
WHAT?
MAUREEN
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a shark to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
LUKE
But...
MAUREEN
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Mary.
MARY grins.

LUKE
But...
MARY
You heard the lady. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
LUKE
Maureen?
MAUREEN
I'm sorry Luke, but I think you should skidaddle.
LUKE leaves.

MARY turns to MAUREEN.

MARY
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
MAUREEN
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.

Suddenly MARY stops.

MARY
When I said I'm afraid of sausages, you know I was just trying to distract the shark don't you? </p>
THE END
